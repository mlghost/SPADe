### Features
SPADe achieves the same high performance as most popular state-of-the-art decoders using only 4M parameters. This is particularly beneficial when working with large backbones or limited resources.

## Installation

The SPADe is developed within the MMSegmentation framework from OpenMMLab. To use SPADe, you can either integrate this implementation into your project as a single model class or embed it into the decoders implemented by MMSegmentation. The implementation is provided in a single file for your convenience.
